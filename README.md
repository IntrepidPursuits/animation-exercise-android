# Android Animation Exercise
## Instructions
1. Fork this repository. 

2. In Android Studio, go to File -> New -> Project from Version Control -> GitHub and paste in the new forked repo's URL: `https://github.com/YourGitHubName/animation-exercise-android.git`

3. Create a branch called `<your-name>/add-animations`

    ```
    git checkout -b <your-name>/add-animations
    ```
4. Download the animation movie files from the `animation_movies` folder in this repository and watch them. Add those animations to the app while preserving all functionality. You'll probably want to start with modifying the three methods marked by the TODOs in `DetailActivity` and `OverviewActivity` (or viewing all TODOs by using âŒ˜ + Shift + A and searching for 'todo' to find the TODO tool).

5. Commit and push your branch up to Github

    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Add animations"
    git push origin <your-name>/add-animations
    ```
6. Create a pull request on GitHub
